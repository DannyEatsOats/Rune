## 🜚 ✦ Disclaimer ✦ 🜚

☉ **Rune is a personal project** built to learn Rust and its capabilities.  
☽ It is **tailored to the warlock's (my) daily terminal rituals**, rather than general user friendliness.  
♄ Use it **at your own risk**, for within its runes lie both power and chaos.
☾ **../** leads to the backrooms, beware.
